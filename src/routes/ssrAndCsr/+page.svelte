<p>SSR or Server Side Rendering and CSR or Client Side Rendering default value is true. SSR true is typically used for static or dynamic content that doesn't require frequent updates or interactivity. 
    CSR true is often used for dynamic, interactive web applications that require frequent updates and real-time interactions. Meaning the ui is rendered in both
 client and server. But if server side rendering is false, the web page is not generated to the server side.

<p>The good thing about SSR and CSR is the seo, it makes the site more visible.</p>
